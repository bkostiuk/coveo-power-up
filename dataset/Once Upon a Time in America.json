Not knowing what to expect, while on a mission to shed light on his opaque past, grizzled Noodles reunites with his only living friend, Fat Moe, after thirty-five haunted years of self-exile. However, the relentless, piercing sound of culpability stands in the way of finding closure, as the inscrutable content of a well-worn leather suitcase further complicates matters. And now, against the backdrop of a torn conscience, the sad and bittersweet recollections of more than fifty years of love, death, and everything in between, become inextricably intertwined, leading to even more puzzling questions. But, what are a man's options when he is left with nothing?", "director": "Sergio Leone", "writer": "Harry Grey;Leonardo Benvenuti", "stars": "Robert De Niro;James Woods;Elizabeth McGovern", "trivia": "Sergio Leone wanted his friend Sylvia Kristel to play the role of Carol, but the producers did not agree on the actress's participation and told the director to employ the \"famous Hollywood star.\"", "languages": "English;Italian;French;Yiddish;Hebrew", "budget": 30000000, "runtime": 229}
