It's been eighteen short months since the deadly confrontation in Per un pugno di dollari (1964), and this time, the solitary stranger, now a professional bounty hunter, will have to go against his beliefs and do the unthinkable: join forces with the hawk-eyed marksman, Colonel Douglas Mortimer, to collect the hefty reward. Now, as El Indio and his cut-throats have already set their sights on robbing the crammed-with-cash Bank of El Paso, the stage is set for a bloody showdown at high noon, against the backdrop of silent double-crosses and fragile allegiances. But, is it worth dicing with death for a few dollars more?", "director": "Sergio Leone", "writer": "Sergio Leone;Fulvio Morsella", "stars": "Clint Eastwood;Lee Van Cleef;Gian Maria Volont\u00e8", "trivia": "Filmed between seasons 7 and 8 of Rawhide.", "languages": "Italian;English", "budget": 600000, "runtime": 132}
