An honorable end to such fate under the samurai code is ritual suicide, or hara-kiri (self-inflicted disembowelment). An elder warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at the house but was instead barbarically forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in an excruciating manner with a dull bamboo blade. In flashbacks the samurai tells the tragic story of his son-in-law, and how he was forced to sell his real sword to support his sick wife and child. Tsugumo thus sets in motion a tense showdown of revenge against the house.", "director": "Masaki Kobayashi", "writer": "Yasuhiko Takiguchi,Shinobu Hashimoto", "stars": "Tatsuya Nakadai,Akira Ishihama,Shima Iwashita", "trivia": "The film explores themes such as honour and hypocrisy.
