He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he thinks he's been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals \"escape\" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.", "director": "Martin Scorsese", "writer": "Laeta Kalogridis;Dennis Lehane", "stars": "Leonardo DiCaprio;Emily Mortimer;Mark Ruffalo", "trivia": "Columbia Pictures first optioned the movie rights to Dennis Lehane's novel in 2003 when it was first published.
