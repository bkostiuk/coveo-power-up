Tolkien,Fran Walsh", "stars": "Elijah Wood,Ian McKellen,Viggo Mortensen", "trivia": "About two hundred to three hundred horses were used in the trilogy. Because most of the scenes involving horses are intense battle scenes, where the horses could likely be harmed, a horse and rider were fitted with the same type of suit that Andy Serkis wore for his role, and were filmed in the studio doing typical \"battle\" things, like galloping and rearing up, so the footage could be inserted digitally into the battle scenes. In that way, no horses were hurt.", "languages": "English,Sindarin,Old English", "budget": 94000000, "runtime": 179}
